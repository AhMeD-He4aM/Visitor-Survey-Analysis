# Visitor Satisfaction Survey Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes survey responses collected from visitors of an exhibition in Saudi Arabia. The goal is to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in satisfaction levels based on demographic variables such as gender, age group, education level, and nationality.

## 🎯 Research Questions
- Are there significant differences in visitor satisfaction based on gender?
- Are satisfaction levels associated with age groups or educational backgrounds?
- Does nationality affect satisfaction levels among exhibition visitors?

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Chi-Square Test
- ANOVA / T-Test
- Power BI

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Cleaned and prepared raw survey data in Excel.
2. Created contingency tables using Pivot Tables.
3. Applied Chi-square test to assess variable independence.
4. Performed ANOVA and t-tests to compare satisfaction levels.
5. Built a dynamic dashboard in Power BI for data visualization.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
A visual dashboard was created using Power BI, including:
- Slicer for Age Group
- Pie Chart for Satisfaction by Nationality
- Bar Chart for Gender & Satisfaction Levels
- Card displaying total survey participants

This interactive dashboard allows users to filter and explore satisfaction trends across demographic variables.

## 📈 Sample Output
| Gender  | Satisfied | Neutral | Dissatisfied | Total |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Male    | 20        | 10      | 8             | 38    |
| Female  | 30        | 20      | 12            | 62    |
| Total   | 50        | 30      | 20            | 100   |

Chi-Square Statistic: 1.49  
p-value: 0.684 → No statistically significant difference by gender.
