# Visitor Satisfaction Survey Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes survey responses collected from visitors of an exhibition in Saudi Arabia. The primary goal is to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in satisfaction levels based on demographic variables such as gender, age group, education level, and nationality.

## 🎯 Research Questions
- Are there significant differences in visitor satisfaction based on gender?
- Are satisfaction levels associated with age groups or educational backgrounds?
- Does nationality affect satisfaction levels among exhibition visitors?

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Chi-Square Test
- ANOVA / T-Test

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Cleaned and prepared raw survey data.
2. Created contingency tables using Pivot Tables in Excel.
3. Applied Chi-square test to check independence between demographic variables and satisfaction.
4. Used ANOVA to analyze differences in satisfaction across more than two groups (e.g., age or education level).
5. Interpreted p-values to determine statistical significance.

## 📈 Example Output
| Gender  | Satisfied | Neutral | Dissatisfied | Total |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Male    | 20        | 10      | 8             | 38    |
| Female  | 30        | 20      | 12            | 62    |
| Total   | 50        | 30      | 20            | 100   |

Chi-Square Statistic: 1.49  
p-value: 0.684 → No statistically significant difference by gender.
